# Three_link_Robotic_Arm_with_Dynamics_control

Designed a planar three-link robot achieved with force control, stimulated by external force with a spring-mass-damper system. And demonstrated with resulting torques of the joints and achieve the desired position while also achieving the required force at the end effector.
